# Assignment-6

1. The purpose of this assignment is to create a show class, complete with initialization function. Use the data in the file to create show objects for each sample in the dataset.
2. The code takes the dataset then proceeds to parse the individual CSV lines with quoted or blank fields then creates a class for each show within the set then loads the parsed lines into the class and finally outputs the show objects.
3. You use the program by utilizing the class keyword which are blueprints for creating objects just like we see in the code.
